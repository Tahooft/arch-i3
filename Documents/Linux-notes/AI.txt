I understand that you want to transform an existing music number into a relaxing music number and change the melody so that it does not conflict with the copyright of the existing music number. It is important to note that changing the melody of an existing song does not necessarily mean that it is free from copyright infringement. 

However, there are some tools that can help you create new melodies that are not copyrighted. For example, you can use an AI music generator like **Junia**² to create a new melody based on your preferences. You can also use transposition techniques to change the key of the existing song, which can give it a different feel and make it more relaxing⁴.

If you want to create a new melody from scratch, you can use an algorithm like the one developed by Damien Riehl and Noah Rubin¹. This algorithm generates every possible melody combination to curb copyright lawsuits. You can use this algorithm to create a new melody that is unique and not copyrighted. However, it is important to note that this algorithm generates every possible melody combination, so it may not be able to generate a melody that is exactly what you are looking for.

I hope this information helps you create a new melody that is relaxing and not copyrighted. Let me know if you have any other questions!
