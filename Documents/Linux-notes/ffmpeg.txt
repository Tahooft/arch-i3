ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "transpose=1" output.mp4

    0 - Rotate by 90 degrees counter-clockwise and flip vertically. This is the default.
    1 - Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise.
    2 - Rotate by 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    3 - Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and flip vertically.
    
To rotate videos by 180 degrees clockwise, you to need to mention transpose parameter two times like below.

$ ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "transpose=2,transpose=2" output.mp4




FFmpeg has three concatenation methods:
1. concat video filter

Use this method if your inputs do not have the same parameters (width, height, etc), or are not the same formats/codecs, or if you want to perform any filtering.

Note that this method performs a re-encode of all inputs. If you want to avoid the re-encode, you could re-encode just the inputs that don't match so they share the same codec and other parameters, then use the concat demuxer to avoid re-encoding everything.

ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv \
-filter_complex "[0:v] [0:a] [1:v] [1:a] [2:v] [2:a] \
concat=n=3:v=1:a=1 [v] [a]" \
-map "[v]" -map "[a]" output.mkv

2. concat demuxer

Use this method when you want to avoid a re-encode and your format does not support file-level concatenation (most files used by general users do not support file-level concatenation).

$ cat mylist.txt
file '/path/to/file1'
file '/path/to/file2'
file '/path/to/file3'
    
$ ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i mylist.txt -c copy output.mp4
